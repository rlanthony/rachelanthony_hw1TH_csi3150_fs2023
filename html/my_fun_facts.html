      <h2>Current Favorite Book: <i>The Fourth Wing </i>by Rebecca Yarros</h2>
      <img

      />
      <p>
        Yarros' <i>The Fourth Wing</i> is my current favorite book because it
        hooks you in right from the first page and transports you to a fantasy
        world with a setting, plot, and characters you will not want to leave.
        The main character Violet challenges the expectations that have been
        imposed on her by society that ultimately will put her life in danger,
        causing her to build relationships with unlikely people in attempt to
        survive.

        the book
