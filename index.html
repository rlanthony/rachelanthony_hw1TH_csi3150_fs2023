        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Rachel Anthony, and I am currently a senior at
          Oakland University studying management information systems and
          computer science. The technical and interpersonal skills I have
          developed in the classroom caused me to develop interests in the data
          analytics and data science fields. Since November 2022, I have worked
          at BorgWarner as an IT Network Mobility Intern supporting mobile
          phones for over 2,000 North American Employees. I have acquired skills
          in problem solving through troubleshooting the hardware and software
          of mobile devices in addition to managing billing and accounts for the
          services. This past summer, I was a Global IT Intern at General Motors
          where I automated one of their change management reports in the
          manufacturing environment to decrease the creation time by 95%.
          Ultimately, my educational and professional experiences spark an
          interest in developing my analytical skills potentially in the
          healthcare, government, or automtive industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to my academics at Oakland University, I was involved in
          the Meadow Brook Ball Committee, serving as President and Tresurer
          during my involvement. This student organization plans the annual ball
          for 300 students using funds generated through fundraisers and student
          organization fundings from the university. During my time on the
          executive board, I acquired skills in budget management, contracts and
          negotiation, event planning, and managing teams of 10-20 individuals.
          All in all, my involvement in this committee allowed me to strengthen
          my communication and interpersonal skills to be effective in the
          corporate environment.
